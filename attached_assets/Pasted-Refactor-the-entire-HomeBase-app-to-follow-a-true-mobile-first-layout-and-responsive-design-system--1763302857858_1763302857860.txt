Refactor the entire HomeBase app to follow a true mobile-first layout and responsive design system. The current UI is designed primarily for desktop, which results in oversized cards, horizontal layouts, and components that are hard to use on mobile. I need the full app updated with the following rules:

1. MOBILE-FIRST APPROACH
   - All screens and components should be designed for mobile first.
   - Use a single-column layout by default.
   - Avoid any horizontal scrolling.
   - Stack sections vertically with consistent spacing (8–16px).

2. RESPONSIVE BREAKPOINTS
   - Base: 360–480px (default mobile)
   - Tablet: 600–900px
   - Desktop: 1024px+
   - Scale up from mobile using media queries (min-width), not scale down.

3. CARDS (Maintenance, Contractors, Products, etc.)
   - Collapse large or complex cards by default.
   - Reduce padding and visual weight.
   - Titles, badges, and key info should fit comfortably in one column.
   - Buttons should be full-width on mobile.

4. NAVIGATION
   - Implement a bottom nav bar for mobile if appropriate.
   - Top nav should collapse into a hamburger menu on small screens.
   - Minimize header height to maintain screen space.

5. TYPOGRAPHY & SIZING
   - Use a clear hierarchy: 
     - h1: 20–24px
     - h2: 16–18px
     - body: 14–15px
     - metadata: 12–13px
   - Ensure readability without large blocks of text.

6. BUTTONS
   - Full-width buttons on mobile.
   - Reduce overly large buttons.
   - Maintain consistent spacing and rounded corners.

7. FORMS & INPUTS
   - Inputs must span 100% width on mobile.
   - Reduce padding so they don’t appear oversized.

8. GRIDS & COLUMNS
   - Replace all multi-column sections (2–3 cards in a row) with single-column stacks on mobile.
   - Reintroduce grids ONLY at tablet and desktop breakpoints.

9. SPACING SYSTEM
   - Use a consistent spacing scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24.
   - Remove excessive whitespace.

10. PERFORMANCE
   - Remove unnecessary nested divs and heavy elements that increase layout load.
   - Clean up unused CSS or styles that conflict with responsive behavior.

Update all pages and components across the app (Maintenance, Contractors, Products, Messages, Achievements, Account, Support) to follow this unified mobile-first system. Provide updated code for each file you modify.
